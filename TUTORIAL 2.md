# Tutorial 2
## Question 1
You are a new programmer working at the faculty. As your first job, you are given a list of registered students and asked to store each student as an object in Java. You are given a skeletal code below to get you started from the previous programmer. Of course, the code is INCOMPLETE and HAS ERRORS. You can ignore the code and start from zero if you wish to. 

| Name | Matric Id | Year |
|:----:|:---------:|:----:|
|Alexa |1007	     |  2		|		 
|Siri  |5018	     |  4		|		 
|Omega |2019	     |  1		|		 
|Beta	 |2371	     |  3		|		

**Task 1 : Registering students with setMethods.**\
a) Create one class, 'Student', with variables matching the list's attributes. Your class should have to get and set methods for each attribute (Eg. setName, getName, setMatricId, getMatricId). Ensure suitable data types and access (public, private) are used. 

class Student{

	String name;
	setName(){
 
  }
  
	getName(){
	}	
 
}

public class Register {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
		student alexaObj = new alexa();
		alexaObj.setName();
		System.out.println(alexaObj.getName());
}
